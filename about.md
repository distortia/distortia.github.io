I am a senior software engineer at [Cars.com](https://cars.com). Our team uses Elixir/Phoenix/Liveview and more. We are always hiring!

My hobbies include roasting coffee, music, archery and the outdoors.

Most of my technical biography can be found in my, probably outdated, [resume](/NickStalterResume.pdf).
