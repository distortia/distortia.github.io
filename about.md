I am a software engineer at [InfluxData](https://influxdata.com). Our team uses Elixir/Phoenix on top of Kubernetes. We are always hiring!

My hobbies include roasting coffee, music, archery and the outdoors.

Most of my technical biography can be found in my, probably outdated, [resume](/NickStalterResume.pdf).
